  He condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteous requirement of the law might
  be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the
  Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things
  of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the
  Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is
  life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not
  subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be.  So then, those who are in the
  flesh cannot please God.
