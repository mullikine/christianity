  the law was our guardian until Christ came
  that we might be justified by faith. 25 Now
  that this faith has come, we are no longer
  under a guardian.

So that means, we followed the law somewhat
blindly and were just obedient to it, and that kept us safe.
It was a tough law but if we kept within it then we probably wouldn't sin.

But now that Christ has come, we may be
justified through faith, and we're no longer
under a guardian.

That means we are mature Christians who can
reason and judge for themself.
