However, as it is written:

  “What no eye has seen,
      what no ear has heard,
  and what no human mind has conceived”[b]—
      the things God has prepared for those who love him—

10 these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit.

The Spirit searches all things, even the deep
things of God. 11 For who knows a person’s
thoughts except their own spirit within them?
In the same way no one knows the thoughts of
God except the Spirit of God. 12 What we have
received is not the spirit of the world, but
the Spirit who is from God, so that we may
understand what God has freely given us.
