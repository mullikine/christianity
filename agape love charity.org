Charity/agape is the only thing which endures, aside from God.

Prophesies fail.
Tongues fail.
Knowledge vanishes away.
Such things are only partial knowledge.
But agape/charity never fails.

  8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be
  prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be
  tongues, they shall cease; whether there be
  knowledge, it shall vanish away.
  
  9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in
  part.
  
  10 But when that which is perfect is come,
  then that which is in part shall be done away.

  13 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
  
  2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
  
  3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
  
  4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
  
  5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
  
  6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
  
  7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
  
  8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.
  
  9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
  
  10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
