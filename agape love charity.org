Charity/agape is the only thing which endures, aside from God.

Prophesies fail.
Tongues fail.
Knowledge vanishes away.
Such things are only partial knowledge.
But agape/charity never fails.

  8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be
  prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be
  tongues, they shall cease; whether there be
  knowledge, it shall vanish away.
  
  9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in
  part.
  
  10 But when that which is perfect is come,
  then that which is in part shall be done away.
