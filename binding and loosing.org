#+BRAIN_PARENTS: kingdom%20of%20God

Matt. 18:18 Jesus offers the binding and
loosing hermeneutical principle to his
followers, named as the church, to aid them in
their ongoing discernment and management of
sin.

- I think what it means is that we use the holy spirit while Christ is inside us to make judgements about sin.
