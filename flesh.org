  15 But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us;
  for after He had said before, 16 k“This is
  the covenant that I will make with them
  after those days, says the Lord: I
  will put My laws into their hearts, and in
  their minds I will write them,” 17 then He
  adds, l“Their sins and their lawless deeds I
  will remember no more.” 18 Now where there is
  5remission of these, there is no longer an
  offering for sin.

  19 Therefore, brethren, having mboldness 6to
  enter nthe Holiest by the blood of Jesus, 20
  by a new and oliving way which He consecrated
  for us, through the veil, that is, His flesh,
  21 and having a High Priest over the house of
  God, 22 let us pdraw near with a true heart
  qin full assurance of faith, having our hearts
  sprinkled from an evil conscience and our
  bodies washed with pure water. 23 Let us hold
  fast the confession of our hope without
  wavering, for rHe who promised is faithful. 24
  And let us consider one another in order to
  stir up love and good works, 25 snot forsaking
  the assembling of ourselves together, as is
  the manner of some, but exhorting one another,
  and tso much the more as you see uthe Day
  approaching.
