  (114) Simon Peter said to them: Let Mariham go
  out from among us, for women are not worthy of
  the life. Jesus said: Look, I will lead her
  that I may make her male, in order that she
  too may become a living spirit resembling you
  males. For every woman who makes herself male
  will enter into the kingdom of heaven.

What is a living spirit?
It's a spirit united with Jesus' spirit and has the Holy Spirit?
A true spirit, surely?
