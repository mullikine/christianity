  8 Beware lest anyone [e]cheat you through
  philosophy and empty deceit, according to the
  tradition of men, according to the basic
  principles of the world, and not according to
  Christ. 9 For in Him dwells all the fullness
  of the Godhead [f]bodily; 10 and you are
  complete in Him, who is the head of all
  [g]principality and power.
