  4 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, 
  
  5 Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices,
  acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. 
  
  6 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he
  that believeth on him shall not be confounded. 
  
  7 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders
  disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, 
  
  8 And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto
  also they were appointed. 
  
  9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the
  praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light; 
  
  10 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have
  obtained mercy.
