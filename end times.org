  Witnessing to All Nations    
  
  (Mark 13:10-13; Luke 21:10-19)    
  
  9Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my    
  name's sake. 10And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. 11And many    
  false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. 12And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax    
  cold. 13But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 14And this gospel of the kingdom shall be    
  preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.    
  
   The Abomination of Desolation    
  
  (Mark 13:14-23; Luke 21:20-24)    
  
  15When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place,    
  (whoso readeth, let him understand:) 16Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains: 17Let him which is on    
  the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house: 18Neither let him which is in the field return back to    
  take his clothes. 19And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! 20But pray ye    
  that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day: 21For then shall be great tribulation, such as was    
  not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. 22And except those days should be shortened,    
  there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened. 23Then if any man shall say    
  unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. 24For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and    
  shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. 25Behold, I    
  have told you before.
