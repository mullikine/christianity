  2 That their hearts might be comforted, being
  knit together in love, and unto all riches of
  the full assurance of understanding, to the
  acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of
  the Father, and of Christ;
  
  3 In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom
  and knowledge.

Yes, when one person, say, arrives at
knowledge of God, and shares with a fellow
brother or sister, they too can have the same
assurance.

This is the propagation of treasures of wisdom
and knowledge, and the mystery of God, the
Father and Christ.

People should be sharing this knowledge with
each other.

  13And one of the company said unto him,
  Master, speak to my brother, that he divide
  the inheritance with me.
  
  14And he said unto him, Man, who made me a
  judge or a divider over you? 15And he said
  unto them, Take heed, and beware of
  covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not
  in the abundance of the things which he
  possesseth.
  
  16And he spake a parable unto them, saying,
  The ground of a certain rich man brought forth
  plentifully: 17And he thought within himself,
  saying, What shall I do, because I have no
  room where to bestow my fruits? 18And he said,
  This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and
  build greater; and there will I bestow all my
  fruits and my goods.
  
  19And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast
  much goods laid up for many years; take thine
  ease, eat, drink, and be merry.
  
  20But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night
  thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose
  shall those things be, which thou hast
  provided? 21So is he that layeth up treasure
  for himself, and is not rich toward God.
