I consider the literalness of some people's interpretation of the bible to bring death, not life.
Without the spirit, the bible condemns.
And also, it condemns basically everyone.

In my opinion, this includes:
- Condemnation of homosexuals.
  - Which the world forces to make homosexuals
    - And what about turning from such things?
- What is a sodomite truly?
  - Surely it's a gang-rapist, rather than homosexual.
- Condemnation of murderers (in the heart. i.e. haters)
  - Which the world forces to make into haters
- Condemnation of liars
  - When the world puts so much pressure on us to fit in so that we lie.
- Condemnation of hypocrites
  - Which the world forces to make hypocrites
    - Should people quit their jobs if they condemn others' relationships?
      - What is worse? Being a hypocrite or a homosexual?

So what is the correct application of the new testament?
I believe it is this:
- we are not condemned for these things.
- we identify against these things.
