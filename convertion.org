  Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner,
  and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You
  died for my sins and rose from the dead. I
  turn from my sins and invite You to come into
  my heart and life. I want to trust and follow
  You as my Lord and Savior.

I personally believe it's not enough.
