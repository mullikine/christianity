#+BRAIN_PARENTS: holy%20spirit

+ [[https://www.emeryhorvath.com/how-the-holy-spirit-of-god-moves-in-your-heart/][John 4:14 (AV)]] 14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.

In this passage, the Spirit of God within is described as a well of water springing up.
Many times that’s exactly how it seems when He speaks up in you.
His words well up or pop up in you.
It is very distinct and often sudden.
His Word, His counsel, His wisdom just springs up from within.
At other times, His thoughts will ‘float up’ inside of you.
This is less distinct and it almost seems like it’s your thoughts.
With experience, you will begin to be able to separate His thoughts from yours.
In all of these cases, the best way to hone is to trust Him.
Ask the Lord for help.
Pray that your thoughts are His thoughts.
