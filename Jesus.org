  15 The Son is the image of the invisible God,
  the firstborn over all creation. 16 For in him
  all things were created: things in heaven and
  on earth, visible and invisible, whether
  thrones or powers or rulers or authorities;
  all things have been created through him and
  for him. 17 He is before all things, and in
  him all things hold together. 18 And he is the
  head of the body, the church; he is the
  beginning and the firstborn from among the
  dead, so that in everything he might have the
  supremacy. 19 For God was pleased to have all
  his fullness dwell in him, 20 and through him
  to reconcile to himself all things, whether
  things on earth or things in heaven, by making
  peace through his blood, shed on the cross
