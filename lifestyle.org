Titus 2:11-14
New International Version

11 For the grace of God has appeared that
offers salvation to all people. 12 It teaches
us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly
passions, and to live self-controlled, upright
and godly lives in this present age, 13 while
we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of
the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus
Christ, 14 who gave himself for us to redeem
us from all wickedness and to purify for
himself a people that are his very own, eager
to do what is good.
