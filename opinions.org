The Bible is idolised by Christians who don't
have gift of the discernment of spirits.
Without the full context, I'm unsure if you
are wrong to say, "I know I'm right." Gut
feelings are crucial for a member of the
Kingdom to carry out discernment. Jesus lives
in us and carries out judgement. All humans
save for Jesus have sin and are so partially
blind. If you read the Bible without
discernment then you are blind following the
blind.
