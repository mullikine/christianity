10 Brothers,1 my heart’s desire and prayer to
God for them is that they may be saved. 2 For
I bear them witness that bthey have a zeal for
God, cbut not according to knowledge. 3 For,
being ignorant of dthe righteousness of God,
and seeking to establish their own, they did
not submit to God’s righteousness. 4 For
eChrist is the end of the law for
righteousness to everyone who believes.2
