#+BRAIN_PARENTS: soul

https://lifehopeandtruth.com/life/life-after-death/spirit-in-man/

Mentions the spirit in man in speaking of what happens to a person upon death:

+ [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%2012%3A7&version=KJV][Ecclesiastes 12:7]] :: “Then the dust will return to the earth as it was, and the spirit will return to God who gave it.”

Some jump to the wrong conclusion that this is
a reference to righteous souls going to
heaven. The context shows this interpretation
is wrong. It says that the spirit of everyone
who dies goes back to God who gave it. The
preceding verses speak of aging and death
taking their natural course in every person.
