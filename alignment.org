#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Brothers, my heart’s desire and prayer to
  God for them is that they may be saved. For
  I bear them witness that they have a zeal for
  God, but not according to knowledge. For,
  being ignorant of the righteousness of God,
  and seeking to establish their own, they did
  not submit to God’s righteousness. For
  Christ is the end of the law for
  righteousness to everyone who believes.2
#+END_SRC

This means that a person must first recognise
that God's righteousness is above their own,
rather than trying to find universal truths of
righteousness without God, say through humanism.
