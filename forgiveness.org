  15 But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us;
  for after He had said before, 16 “This is
  the covenant that I will make with them
  after those days, says the Lord: I
  will put My laws into their hearts, and in
  their minds I will write them,” 17 then He
  adds, “Their sins and their lawless deeds I
  will remember no more.” 18 Now where there is
  5 remission of these, there is no longer an
  offering for sin.
