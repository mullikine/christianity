  (114) Simon Peter said to them: Let Mariham go
  out from among us, for women are not worthy of
  the life. Jesus said: Look, I will lead her
  that I may make her male, in order that she
  too may become a living spirit resembling you
  males. For every woman who makes herself male
  will enter into the kingdom of heaven.

What is a living spirit?
It's a spirit united with Jesus' spirit and has the Holy Spirit?
A true spirit, surely?

I think it's a spirit which recognises what is
Truth (hears God's voice) and the spiritual
heart seeks after more of God's voice.

That may include interpreting the Gospel of
Thomas, for example, or reading from John.

Or reading from the Apostles - Reading Acts, for example, for learning on how to imitate Jesus and the Apostles.

=Reality itself changes=

Continue to imbibe on Jesus' words.

As I do that, my entire reality will start to change.
I am becoming a living spirit, yes, and more alive each day.

It's important to become more alive each day.
