I consider the literalness of some people's interpretation of the bible to bring death, not life.
Without the spirit, the bible condemns.
And also, it condemns basically everyone.

+ [[https://biblehub.com/nkjv/galatians/5.htm][Galatians 5:18]] :: But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.

This means, literally, that you may break and are not condemned by 'the law' if you are led by the spirit.
Which law? I believe this means God's law.

This is why in the virtual reality, metaverse,
gender-fluid future, we must worship in spirit
and truth.

In my opinion, this includes:
- Condemnation of homosexuals.
  - Which the world forces to make homosexuals
    - And what about turning from such things?
- What is a sodomite truly?
  - Surely it's a gang-rapist, rather than homosexual.
  - Even if it is homosexuality, which it might be, we still live in an age where we must worship in spirit and truth, not the letter of the law.
    - I believe God's law
      - Rebellion against God is something we are born in to, and the word's rebellion is getting worse, not looking back towards God.
        - God allows it.
- Condemnation of murderers (in the heart. i.e. haters)
  - Which the world forces to make into haters
- Condemnation of liars
  - When the world puts so much pressure on us to fit in so that we lie.
- Condemnation of hypocrites
  - Which the world forces to make hypocrites
    - Should people quit their jobs if they condemn others' relationships?
      - What is worse? Being a hypocrite or a homosexual?

So what is the correct application of the new testament?
I believe it is this:
- we are not condemned for these things.
- we identify against these things.
