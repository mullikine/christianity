2 Corinthians 5:18-20
New International Version
18 All this is from God, who reconciled us to
himself through Christ and gave us the
ministry of reconciliation: 19 that God was
reconciling the world to himself in Christ,
not counting people’s sins against them. And
he has committed to us the message of
reconciliation. 20 We are therefore Christ’s
ambassadors, as though God were making his
appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s
behalf: Be reconciled to God.
